# Polyp-Segmentation-using-Majority-Voiting-FYP


# Abstract 
Colo-rectal cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in the recent few years. Recent studies show that 80%-95% are found in the intestine which would be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. However, the conventional method is screening and diagnosis in colonoscopy that is highly dependent on the expert endoscopist skills & analyzing experience. Even though many methods to challenge the polyps detection and segmentation bench-marking state-of-the-art methods still remains a problem. Therefore our main goal is to obtain an early and accurate diagnosis of polyps in the early stage.For we use a state-of-the-art Deep Learning Model with different backbone architecture(Res- Net50) and (Res-Net101) and U-net to enhance the performance and detection.For this we used pre-trained models on the polyps datasets, Kvasir-SEG, CVC-Clinic 612.we present the UNET architecture for the polyps segmentation in addition to proposing a novel com- bination of UNET and other Neural networks to enhance the performance
